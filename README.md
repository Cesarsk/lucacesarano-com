# Welcome to lucacesarano.com

This is my enabled CI / CD website developed in React. Feel free to give it a look and if you need some info, just
e-mail me.

### You're free to work but...
...I am curious to know how you're going to use this template, so send me a message! 

## Technology Stack

## Frontend

For the website itself, React and Javascript are used. I'm not a frontend developer expert, so I use this website as a
Sandbox to keep my content online and, at the same, to experiment with the said technology.

## Gitlab Runner

CI / CD is set up in the project, there are two pipelines:

- develop:

      code in this pipeline are built and then deployed on beta.lucacesarano.com
- master:

      a marge request triggers this pipeline that buidl and deploy on lucacesarano.com

## Firebase

Firebase was used for hosting the content, behind a Cloudflare provider for the domain. It's free (Spark Plan) so it's
very useful to develop your website virtually for free.

## Run developing environment

    clone repository
    install dependencies in package.json
    npm start

## About me

technology.
