# Welcome to lucacesarano.com

This is my enabled CI / CD website developed in React. Feel free to give it a look and if you need some info, just send
me an e-mail.

disclaimer: even though nothing blocks you from branching this project, I'd really like to know how and why are you
branching it, so please hit me up :)

## Gitlab Runner

CI / CD is set up in the project, there are two pipelines:

- develop:

      code in this pipeline are built and then deployed on beta.lucacesarano.com
- master:

      code in this pipeline are build and then deployed on lucacesarano.com

## React

The website is entirely developed in React and it's a one-page app.

## Firebase

Firebase was used for hosting purpose, behind a Cloudflare provider for the domain. It's free (Spark Plan) so it's very
useful to develop your website at almost no cost (you just need to buy the domain but that cost really a few).

### Other Projects

You may look into other projects of mine via my website, just browser it and check it out.

## Run developing environment

    brew install node
